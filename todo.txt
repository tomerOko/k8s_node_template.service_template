so each service / package will be a different git repo. end every pakcage will registered in npm
save the hash table as an npm package and use it in other project
do 
1. save the hash table as an npm package
2. integrate with the bps repository advantages
3. docker for local development
* skaffold 
* ingress
* nats event bus
* scripts
* doc
* jest
* lunch config
* 2 tsconfig
* add some design patterns example
a run script? - check in other service
shared types folder?
readme
integrate with the bps repository advantages
share content between containers

what about the db
    * need to learn about it never used persistant data in k8s] 
    * with docker compouse u could just mount a directory from the OS file system


run : 

in production
-------------
    so there is a cluster running in the cloud, getting http requests 
    from a cloudFront/cloundFlare to an ingress to a service(that includs load balancer) to the pod's networking drive
    the a specifi port that nodeJS registered itself as the listener
    and now the request's finaly made it into Express


in local development
-------------
    so there is a cluster running locally getting requests from postman/ngrok/browser throw custom host
    a ingress to a service(that includs load balancer) to the pod's networking drive
    the a specifi port that nodeJS registered itself as the listener
    and now the request's finaly made it into Express


in cloud development
-------------
    so there is a a cluster and a replica cluster for dev, both running in the cloud, 
    skaffold sync files from the local machine / rebuild image from the local machine to docker hub and rebuild the pod from that image , 
    getting http requests from a cloudFront/cloundFlare to an ingress to a service(that includs load balancer) to the pod's networking drive
    the a specifi port that nodeJS registered itself as the listener
    and now the request's finaly made it into Express



in hybrid development (only the the one service being developed run's locally)
-------------
    so there is a a cluster and a replica cluster for dev, both running in the cloud, 
    option 1)   the cluster considering the local machine as part of the resource grop and the deployment of the 
                pod being developed run's locally, snd skaffold do its thing locally (no need to go through docker hub)
    option 2)   the event bus just sends https requests to the serviec running locally like any other external resource
    option 3)   maybe k8s have some out of the box solution for



    so there is a cluster running locally getting requests from postman/ngrok/browser throw custom host
    a ingress to a service(that includs load balancer) to the pod's networking drive
    the a specifi port that nodeJS registered itself as the listener
    and now the request's finaly made it into Express


what being part of the cluster give to a deployment
1. it gets the compute power it's nedded
2. it can get 
3. it gets reloded
4. insted of having public ip for every running container, only the cluster gets a public ip. 
    then ther is ingresses reciving the reqest snd redirect's all of them by http header 'host name' to clusterIP services
    then

export as a npm private repo

* think what part of the compilation shuld avoid the test files 
** what part are there?

*** for debug compilations
**** i think that while debugging tsc work regullarly just create files that lets the compiller do the maching between ts code and build code
**** shuld not avoid test while debugging


*** for nodemon localy compilation to memory
**** it compile all files that are imported in the root file and run the root file as script -
**** so there is two option 
1: import all script to an 'index' file and have two 'lunch' configurations for the debuggers
**** maybe it isn't common to debug tests?
**** nodemon shuld probably run seperatly for fanctionality run and for test run

*** for build in order to run in production

*** for test runs

* how can i get smarter now?
** meditate
** drink water
** do straches
** eat some carbs - like a cookie or crasunt


nodemon index.ts   = build to memory and run
tsc  = build 
VScode debugg lunch bottum   = build to memory with mapping and run + run the vscode dubbeger interface
jest   = build all .test.ts and imported files to memory + and run jest binaries on them?
