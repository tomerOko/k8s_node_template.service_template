* should 'server' and 'app' be a class or a script? - ðŸ¥¸a classðŸ¥¸
        - pro's of script:
                1. no constructor so no need to inject anything
                2. no need to instantiate 
        - pro's of class:
                1. a constructor that I can inject dependencies into like
                        a. for server
                        - a mock app
                        - a mock environment
                        b. for app
                        - mock dependencies instead of npm packages - (better do with jest's mock module?)'
                        - mock router
        shuld ENV properties, db connections, or what ever, be a dependency of the server?

* should server creation be asynchronous? ðŸ¥¸nope - logycaly this is a synchronous processðŸ¥¸
        - if yes: should index.ts import it as IFEE?
