* think what part of the compilation shuld avoid the test files 
        -   there is a test container, dev container, build container, and prod container,
        the test container compile the logic and tests and run the tests, the dev container 
        also compile them both but run test only if commanded, the build container (or through
        the dev container command), will run tsc with a production tsConfig file the will
        not compile test (and not dev dependecies, set appropriate environment variables, and more..)
