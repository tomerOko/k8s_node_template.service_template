    1. proper middlewares (validation, security(rate limiter, body check))
    1.2. proper dependency injection 
        a. (there is somewhere small research I made on the best DI container npm package)
        b. didn't find that research but:
            I. refresh my memory no depndency inversion (testability (injecting mocks), easy dev,) 
    2. propper error handling
        1. a documented standard
        2. un handeled requests
        3. response codes
    3. syntax standards
    4. DB connectors (let's say mongo, MySQL, Postgres)
    5. cashing with Redis?
    6. proper prod/dev configs
    7. proper logging
        a. standard for matrixes
        b. avoid logging secrets
        c. readable by humans and machines
        d. more best practices
    8. proper documentation
        a. update readme
        b. read about documentation best practices
        c. an automatic documentation solution
    9. proper tests (unit + end to end)
        a. unit test examples
        b. integration test examples
        c. end to end test examples
        d. different test scripts (allFiles/openFiles, verbose?, watch?)
        e. different test debug (lunch) configs (all Files/open Files, verbose?, watch?)
    10. proper environment variable loading
        a. comment above every group in what module are they used
        b. separate to files? 
        c. a single source of truth (having eventually one single place that concentrates all the environment settings)
        d. a template
b. configs best practices (production/dev, package.json variables, Dockerfile variables, config maps variables, secrets variable, jenkins variable)
c. create different tsconfig.json files for 'prod' and 'dev' 
d. add some design patterns example
e. security
    1. HTTPS handshake - recall this,
    2. JWT - then learn this
f. server.ts, index.ts, and app.ts best practices
g. keeping with the k8s course - connecting to a streaming service (changes the structure of the services)
h. learn about modules/namespaces
i. design patterns
